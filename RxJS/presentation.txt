######## WHAT IS ########
...is a set of libraries to compose asynchronous and event-based programs using observable collections
and Array#extras style composition in JavaScript.

Project actively developed by Microsoft, in collaboration with a community of open source developers.

####### WHY #######
Modern websites are not anymore static page with simple animation but are complex system
composed of asynchronous flows that interacting transform our simple website to complex web application.

Promise, web-workers, web-sockets, DOM-events, infrastructure synchronization: are all sources of async data
that could be viewed as a single data model => Stream of data.

In order to manage multiple asynchronous flows we need a more approchable data structure that give us
the strength to build systems that will be: event/message-driven, resilient, scalable, responsive.

We are going to call this kind of systems "Reactive Architectures".
