Esempi:

1) basic.js         -> observable creation . NO
2) operators.js     -> some merging operators
3) ajax-wrapped.js  -> create your own Observable
4) hot-cold.js      -> difference between two type of Observable
5) draggable.js     -> DOM focus
6) autocomplete.js  -> retry focus

#SLIDE: Hot vs Cold
Cold observable:
  - start emitting when a observer subscibe
  - end emitting when the observe dispose
  - for each subscriber will be created a new observable

Hot observable:
  - shared among multiple subscriber
  - continue emitting value
  - thin about dom events, no matter if a listener has been attached


#SLIDE: Conslusion
Pros:
  - great abstraction for asyc and events
  - support for many languages: [lista di linguaggi supportati]
  - easy composable => reactive systems
  - performance => for big array processing, it remove intermediate array allocation
  - super powerful operators

Cons:
  - too many operators that can lead to the same results
  - learning curve
  - not enough examples and tutorial
